The idea is to provide you with an fast and simple way to learn CP4WAIOPS.\nYou will learn about the following topics: Installing AIManager from scratch Integrate AIManager with OpenLDAP for user management Integrate AIManager with ELK for Log Anomalies Define and train AI Models for Log Anomaly Detectiom Metric Anomaly Detection Event Grouping Similar Incidents Change Risk Create Policies for Story creation and Runbook assignment Integrate AIManager with Ansible Tower and create Runbooks in AIManager Create a RobotShop Application Topology Integrate AIManager with Slack and those are the Topics that you are going to work on during this Training: Prerequisites In this chapter you will provision your OpenShift Cluster for the training. Installing the Operator In this chapter you will prepare your Cluster for the installation of AIManager\nPrepare your PC or Mac to run commands against your cluster Create the Namespace Create the IBM Operator Catalog Install the CP4WAIOPS Operator Installing AIManager IIn this chapter you will install AIManager into your Cluster. Installing Training resources In this chapter you will install resources that you will need for the configuration of AIManager in the next chapter.\nThose are assets that typically already exist at a customer:\nOpenLDAP AWX (Open Source Ansible Tower) with preloaded Playbooks RobotShop Demo App Demo Service Account This will also load Training Data for:\nLog Anomalies\nYou will integrate with your live ELK instance but you probably don\u0026rsquo;t have 2-3 days to wait for ELK to collect enough logs. So we\u0026rsquo;ll train on this pre-canned Log Data.\nMetric Anomalies\nFor this training we won\u0026rsquo;t have a Metric provider (Instana, \u0026hellip;) so we\u0026rsquo;ll train on pre-canned Metric Data. If you want you can always integrate an existing Metric Source on top of the provided training data.\nService Now - Similar Incidents\nFor this training we won\u0026rsquo;t have a Service Now Instance so we\u0026rsquo;ll train on pre-canned SNOW Data. If you want you can always integrate an existing SNOW instance on top of the provided training data. You can find documentation here\nConfigure AIManager In this chapter you will:\nIntegrate AIManager with OpenLDAP for user management Integrate AIManager with ELK for Log Anomalies Create Policies for Story creation and Runbook assignment Integrate AIManager with Ansible Tower and create Runbooks in AIManager Create a RobotShop Application Topology Train the Models In this chapter you will:\nDefine and train AI Models for Log Anomaly Detectiom Metric Anomaly Detection Event Grouping Similar Incidents Change Risk Test And Demo In this chapter you will verify that your environment if working properly by simulating a test incident. Configure Slack (optional) In this chapter you will integrate AIManager with Slack "},{"id":2,"href":"/cp4waiops-training/introduction/intro_01/","title":"Basic Architecture","parent":"Introduction","content":" Basic Architecture The environement (Kubernetes, Applications, \u0026hellip;) create logs that are being fed into a Log Management Tool (ELK in this case).\nExternal Systems generate Alerts and send them into the AIManager for Event Grouping. At the same time AIManager ingests the raw logs coming from the Log Management Tool (ELK) and looks for anomalies in the stream based on the trained model. It also ingests Metric Data and looks for anomalies If it finds an anomaly (logs and/or metrics) it forwards it to the Event Grouping as well. Out of this, AIManager creates a Story that is being enriched with Topology (Localization and Blast Radius) and with Similar Incidents that might help correct the problem. The Story is then sent to Slack. A Runbook is available to correct the problem but not launched automatically.

If you have Pods in 0/0 state verify the Events. If you get Not enough CPU then delete the cluster and provision the correct size. When deploying ROKS I usually use Dallas or London, they are the fastest. On other regions we have seen much worse performance - deployment can take 4-5 times longer. If you see Pods in CrashLoop or other error states, try to wait it out (this can be due to dependencies on other componenets that are not ready yet). Chances are that the deployment will eventually go through. If after 8h you are still stuck, ping me. Simply put:\n❗ Be patient and make sure you have the correct size of cluster provisioned!

For example, the creation of the following story number 9 in Slack:\nThis story has a corresponding incident created in ServiceNow. To access these incidents, from the ServiceNow home page search for agent, and click on Agent Workspace Home, as shown below\nIn the Agent Workspace, if you click on the burger menu and select Watson AIOps Incidents, you will see the list of incidents created by Watson AIOps as shown below\nThis is the incident in ServiceNow that corresponds to the story number 9 that was mentioned before\nHistorical similar incidents When an incident occurs, it can be helpful to review details for similar incidents to help determine a resolution. This AI model aggregates information about similar messages, anomalies, and events for a component or application. It can also extract the steps used to fix previous incidents, if documented. Training this AI model will help you discover historical incidents to aid in the remediation of current problems.\nImportant: Incidents in ServiceNow must contain meaningful entries in the Resolution notes (close_notes value in the logs) field to successfully populate the Search recommended actions feature in your ChatOps interface. If your incidents do not include resolutions, or include default entires like Closed by Caller, these values do not identify paths to remediation. As a result, empty or non-meaningful entries yield no results in your ChatOps interface because they provide no potential actions.\nThe process can be defined in the following steps:\nChange at least five existing incidents in your ServiceNow developer instance in order to match the stories you already have in Slack. To see the existing sample incidents in your ServiceNow developer instance search for incidents and select Service Desk -\u0026gt; Incidents as shown below Select an existing open incident and update the description and short description with some known log anomaly error from an existing story. For example the next picture shows the description as \u0026ldquo;Unknown Error web\u0026rdquo;. Then click on the Resolution Information tab and Close the incident with resolution code Solved and fill the Resolution Notes with some resolution such as \u0026ldquo;web service was restarted\u0026rdquo;. Repeat this process for at least five tickets.\nNow we can load the historical incidents data. We will verify that there is no incident data loaded yet by running the following command \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt;login into the cluster\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; oc exec -it `oc get pods|grep ai-platform-api-server|awk \u0026#39;{print $1;}\u0026#39;` bash Now run the following CURL command\ncurl --insecure -u $ES_USERNAME:$ES_PASSWORD -X GET https://$ES_ENDPOINT/_cat/indices -k|sort|grep -e incident -e snow yellow open snowchangerequest tyEtirBzSh6sAgN6mVc51g 1 1 0 0 208b 208b yellow open snowincident bEX48U3rT4GzpM0zt6Mgaw 1 1 0 0 208b 208b As you can see there is no data yet.\nWe will enable the incident data flow now.\nFrom the Home page click on Data and tool integrations.\nClick on the ServiceNow integration and select Edit.\nFrom the integration form, we will pull data by selecting \u0026ldquo;Data Flow\u0026rdquo; ON,\nCheck \u0026ldquo;Historical data for initial AI training\u0026rdquo; and\nSelect a start/end date to cover the existing sample incidents in the ServiceNow developer instance.

Click on the ServiceNow integration and select the 3dot menu on the far right and select \u0026ldquo;Disable Ticket Data Flow\u0026rdquo;.\nNow its time to use that data for historical similar incident training. Click AI Model Management from the Home page and select the Similar Incidents card as shown below. Create a training definition by clicking on the Create Training Definition button. Select \u0026ldquo;manually\u0026rdquo; for the schedule option and click save.

Select a story that has a reference to the updated incident you did previously and click on Search Similar Incident button As we can see in the previous picture, when we click search, a historical incident is found and a summary of the ticket resolution activities are shown. You can click on the text in blue to go to the actual ticket in your ServiceNow developer instance.\nPulling inventory and topology data from ServiceNow Using the WAIOPS ServiceNow Observer job, you can retrieve the Configuration Management Database (CMDB) data from ServiceNow. The ServiceNow developer instance comes loaded with sample topology and inventory data. In this section, we will define an observer job to pull this information into WAIOPS, that can be later be seen from the Topology Viewer.\nServiceNow CMDB The ServiceNow Configuration Management data base creates and maintains the logical configurations the network infrastructure needs to support a ServiceNow service. These logical service configurations are mapped to the physical layout data of the supporting network and application infrastructure in each of the respective domains. They track the physical and logical state of IT service elements and associate incidents to the state of service elements, which helps in analyzing trends and reducing problems and incidents. The configurations are stored in a configuration management database which consists of entities, called Configuration Items (CI), that are part of your environment. A CI may be:\nA physical entity, such as a computer or router A logical entity, such as an instance of a database Conceptual, such as a Requisition Service A CI does not exist on its own. CIs have dependencies and relationship with other CIs. For example, the loss of disk drives may take a database instance down, which affects the requisition service that the HR department uses to order equipment for new employees.\nIn order to see existing CMDB data in ServiceNow, from the developer instance home page, from the top left you can search for CI, click on CI Class Manager and click the \u0026lsquo;Hierarchy\u0026rsquo; button at the upper left of this page to start the CI Class Manager.\nFor example, on the CI Classes column, click on Hardware, select the CI List to see the actual items and search for SAP. You will find a number of SAP servers own by the Lenovo Organization as shown below. We will see these same SAP servers later in the Topology Viewer in WAIOPS.\nServiceNow Observer Job In CP4WAIOPS there are two ways to enable a ServiceNow observer job: the first way is inside the ServiceNow main integration form and the second way is as a regular observer job. In this cookbook, we will follow the second option.\nFrom the WAIOPS home page, click on Data and tool integrations, then click on the Advanced tab and finally select Manage observer jobs. You will see the list of available observers after you click on the Add a new job card as shown below (note that the number of observer cards will vary depending on what observers are enabled in your WAIOPS instance)\nClick on the ServiceNow card and complete the observer job form as shown below:\nUnique ID: Be sure to give your job a unique name so you can recognize it in the future. ServiceNow instance: Specify the URL of the ServiceNow developer instance. ServiceNow username: Specify the same ServiceNow events user username you configured before under the Creating ServiceNow integrations section. ServiceNow password: Specify the same encrypted password you configured before under the Creating ServiceNow integrations section. Leave the optional Additional parameters section unchanged. Click on the Job schedule section and confirm that Run time is set to now and Time interval as once only\nThe following screenshot shows the complete form:\nFinally click on Save to save the observer job configuration and run the job. This job will pull all the existing topology and inventory data from your ServiceNow developer instance into WAIOPS.\nServiceNow Observer Job logs After you let the job run, lets check the logs of the observer pod by running the following command:\noc logs `oc get pods|grep servicenow-observer|awk \u0026#39;{print $1;}\u0026#39;` \u0026gt; servicenow-observer-logs.txt Open the log output file servicenow-observer-logs.txt and verify that you see log lines like those shown below:\nINFO [2021-05-21 19:08:45,222] [dw-28 - POST /1.0/servicenow-observer/jobs/load] c.i.i.t.o.a.JobPostApi - dw-28 - POST /1.0/servicenow-observer/jobs/load - submitJobRequest - Accepted job id: DcXec2deRKyC4GbcHmygew, name: ServiceNow Observer Job 1, for scheduling.

From the WAIOPS home page click on Topology viewer and search for Lenovo and click on the search result blue target. You will see that the topology for the ServiceNow Organization Lenovo is shown. If you zoom-in, you will see that this topology includes the SAP servers (SAP-SD-01, SAP-SD-02, etc) we saw before in ServiceNow.\nEncrypting the Service Now Password Important: You must specify an IBM Cloud Pak for Watson AIOps encrypted version of your ServiceNow password to collect inventory and topology data from ServiceNow. To encrypt your ServiceNow password, complete the following steps:\nMake sure that you have oc installed on your local system. For more information about these requirements, see Preparing to install IBM Cloud Pak for Watson AIOps. Log in to your Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster by using the oc login command. You can identify your specific oc login by clicking the user name dropdown menu in the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform console, then clicking Copy Login Command.\nSwitch your project to where the Cloud Pak for Watson AIOps is installed (e.g. cp4waiops) using the following command (use your own project name):\noc project cp4waiops Identify the full name for the evtmanager-topology-topology pod: oc get pods | grep evtmanager-topology-topology Enter the following command to encrypt your password.
