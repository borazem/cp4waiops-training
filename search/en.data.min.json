At the same time AI Manager ingests the raw logs coming from the Log Management Tool (ELK) and looks for anomalies in the stream based on the trained model. It also ingests Metric Data and looks for anomalies If it finds an anomaly (logs and/or metrics) it forwards it to the Event Grouping as well. Out of this, AI Manager creates a Story that is being enriched with Topology (Localization and Blast Radius) and with Similar Incidents that might help correct the problem. The Story is then sent to Slack. A Runbook is available to correct the problem but not launched automatically.

If you have Pods in 0/0 state verify the Events. If you get Not enough CPU then delete the cluster and provision the correct size. When deploying ROKS I usually use Dallas or London, they are the fastest. On other regions we have seen much worse performance - deployment can take 4-5 times longer. If you see Pods in CrashLoop or other error states, try to wait it out (this can be due to dependencies on other componenets that are not ready yet). Chances are that the deployment will eventually go through. If after 8h you are still stuck, ping me. ‚ùó So simply put: be patient and make sure you have the correct size of cluster provisioned!
