The idea is to provide you with an fast and simple way to learn CP4WAIOPS.\nYou will learn about the following topics: Installing AIManager from scratch Integrate AIManager with OpenLDAP for user management Integrate AIManager with ELK for Log Anomalies Define and train AI Models for Log Anomaly Detectiom Metric Anomaly Detection Event Grouping Similar Incidents Change Risk Create Policies for Story creation and Runbook assignment Integrate AIManager with Ansible Tower and create Runbooks in AIManager Create a RobotShop Application Topology Integrate AIManager with Slack and those are the Topics that you are going to work on during this Training: Prerequisites In this chapter you will provision your OpenShift Cluster for the training. Installing the Operator In this chapter you will prepare your Cluster for the installation of AIManager\nPrepare your PC or Mac to run commands against your cluster Create the Namespace Create the IBM Operator Catalog Install the CP4WAIOPS Operator Installing AIManager IIn this chapter you will install AIManager into your Cluster. Installing Training resources In this chapter you will install resources that you will need for the configuration of AIManager in the next chapter.\nThose are assets that typically already exist at a customer:\nOpenLDAP AWX (Open Source Ansible Tower) with preloaded Playbooks RobotShop Demo App Demo Service Account This will also load Training Data for:\nLog Anomalies\nYou will integrate with your live ELK instance but you probably don\u0026rsquo;t have 2-3 days to wait for ELK to collect enough logs. So we\u0026rsquo;ll train on this pre-canned Log Data.\nMetric Anomalies\nFor this training we won\u0026rsquo;t have a Metric provider (Instana, \u0026hellip;) so we\u0026rsquo;ll train on pre-canned Metric Data. If you want you can always integrate an existing Metric Source on top of the provided training data.\nService Now - Similar Incidents\nFor this training we won\u0026rsquo;t have a Service Now Instance so we\u0026rsquo;ll train on pre-canned SNOW Data. If you want you can always integrate an existing SNOW instance on top of the provided training data. You can find documentation here\nConfigure AIManager In this chapter you will:\nIntegrate AIManager with OpenLDAP for user management Integrate AIManager with ELK for Log Anomalies Create Policies for Story creation and Runbook assignment Integrate AIManager with Ansible Tower and create Runbooks in AIManager Create a RobotShop Application Topology Train the Models In this chapter you will:\nDefine and train AI Models for Log Anomaly Detectiom Metric Anomaly Detection Event Grouping Similar Incidents Change Risk Test And Demo In this chapter you will verify that your environment if working properly by simulating a test incident.

At the same time AIManager ingests the raw logs coming from the Log Management Tool (ELK) and looks for anomalies in the stream based on the trained model. It also ingests Metric Data and looks for anomalies If it finds an anomaly (logs and/or metrics) it forwards it to the Event Grouping as well. Out of this, AIManager creates a Story that is being enriched with Topology (Localization and Blast Radius) and with Similar Incidents that might help correct the problem. The Story is then sent to Slack. A Runbook is available to correct the problem but not launched automatically.

If you have Pods in 0/0 state verify the Events. If you get Not enough CPU then delete the cluster and provision the correct size. When deploying ROKS I usually use Dallas or London, they are the fastest. On other regions we have seen much worse performance - deployment can take 4-5 times longer. If you see Pods in CrashLoop or other error states, try to wait it out (this can be due to dependencies on other componenets that are not ready yet). Chances are that the deployment will eventually go through. If after 8h you are still stuck, ping me. Simply put:\n❗ Be patient and make sure you have the correct size of cluster provisioned!
