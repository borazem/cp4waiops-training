# Create your Slack Workspace

{{< step title="Create your Slack Workspace" >}}



1. Create a Slack workspace by going to https://slack.com/get-started#/createnew and logging in with an email <i>**which is not your IBM email**</i>. Your IBM email is part of the IBM Slack enterprise account and you will not be able to create an independent Slack workspace outside if the IBM slack service.

    Give your workspace a unique name such as aiops-\<yourname\>.

5. Describe the workspace current purpose

    This is free text, you may simply write “demo for Watson AIOps” or whatever you like.

6. Add team members

    You may add team members to your new Slack workspace or skip this step.


At this point you have created your own Slack workspace where you are the administrator and can perform all the necessary steps to integrate with CP4WAOps.
