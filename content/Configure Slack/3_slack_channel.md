{{< hint type=note title="Tip" >}}
You can name the channel whatever you want.
{{< /hint >}}

2. Right click on each channel and select `Copy Link`

	This should get you something like this https://xxxx.slack.com/archives/C021QOY16BW
	The last part of the URL is the channel ID (i.e. C021QOY16BW). 
	
	
{{< hint type=note title="Tip" >}}
Write them down for both channels
{{< /hint >}}

3. Under Apps click Browse Apps
