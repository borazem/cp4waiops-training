# Check  AI Manager is ready


> üí° This takes some time depending on what region of ROKS you have chosen.

> ‚ùó Wait **up to 45 minutes** for the installation to complete. The next step explains how to follow the installation progress.


## Check with the Command Line

Run the following:
	
```bash
while :; do clear; echo "Checking..."; echo "Exit with Ctrl-C"; oc get po -n cp4waiops | grep -v Completed | grep -v Error |grep "0/"; oc get po -n cp4waiops | grep -v Completed | grep -v Error |grep -v "0/" |wc -l| tr -d ' '; oc get po -n cp4waiops | grep -v Completed | grep -v Error |grep "0/" |wc -l| tr -d ' '; sleep 2; done
```

This will list the Pods that are not Ready yet.

üöÄ And **when done** you should get only the numbers `129` and `0`.
