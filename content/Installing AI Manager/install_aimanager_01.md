{{< task title="Verify that the AIManager Installation is ready" link="https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/cloud-paks/cloud-pak-watson-aiops/3.5.0?topic=manager-starter-installation-cli" >}}

## Check with the Command Line

Run the following:
	
```bash
while :; do clear; echo "Checking..."; echo "Exit with Ctrl-C"; echo "---------------"; echo "Not Ready: $(oc get po -n cp4waiops | grep -v Completed | grep -v Error |grep -v '0/' |wc -l| tr -d ' ')"; echo "Ready:     $(oc get po -n cp4waiops | grep -v Completed | grep -v Error |grep '0/' |wc -l| tr -d ' ')"; echo "---------------"; oc get po -n cp4waiops | grep -v Completed | grep -v Error |grep '0/'; sleep 5; done
```

This will list the Pods that are not Ready yet.
