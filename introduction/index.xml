The idea is to provide you with an fast and simple way to learn CP4WAIOPS.
You will learn about the following topics: Installing AIManager from scratch Integrate AIManager with OpenLDAP for user management Integrate AIManager with ELK for Log Anomalies Define and train AI Models for Log Anomaly Detectiom Metric Anomaly Detection Event Grouping Similar Incidents Change Risk Create Policies for Story creation and Runbook assignment Integrate AIManager with Ansible Tower and create Runbooks in AIManager Create a RobotShop Application Topology Integrate AIManager with Slack and those are the Topics that you are going to work on during this Training: Prerequisites In this chapter you will provision your OpenShift Cluster for the training.</description></item><item><title>Basic Architecture</title><link>https://niklaushirt.github.io/cp4waiops-training/introduction/intro_01/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Nov 2022 10:57:46 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://niklaushirt.github.io/cp4waiops-training/introduction/intro_01/</guid><description>Basic Architecture The environement (Kubernetes, Applications, &amp;hellip;) create logs that are being fed into a Log Management Tool (ELK in this case).
External Systems generate Alerts and send them into the AIManager for Event Grouping. At the same time AIManager ingests the raw logs coming from the Log Management Tool (ELK) and looks for anomalies in the stream based on the trained model. It also ingests Metric Data and looks for anomalies If it finds an anomaly (logs and/or metrics) it forwards it to the Event Grouping as well.</description></item><item><title>Training Architecture</title><link>https://niklaushirt.github.io/cp4waiops-training/introduction/intro_02/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Nov 2022 10:57:46 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://niklaushirt.github.io/cp4waiops-training/introduction/intro_02/</guid><description> Optimized Training Architecture For the this specific Demo environment:
ELK is installed for you to kearn how to integrate it For Log Anomaly simulation we&amp;rsquo;ll beusing pre-canned logs for the anomaly detection (inception) For Metrics, we&amp;rsquo;ll be using pre-canned metric data for training and for the anomaly detection (inception) The Events will be created from pre-canned content that is injected into AIManager There are also pre-canned ServiceNow Incidents as we don’t do the live integration with SNOW for this training The Webpages that are reachable from the Events are static and hosted on my GitHub The same goes for ServiceNow Incident pages if you don’t integrate with live SNOW</description></item></channel></rss>
